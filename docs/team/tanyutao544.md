### Project: SoC InternApply

`to be added soon`

SoC InternApply - SoC InternApply helps CS students to track internship applications they are interested in. It is optimised for users who prefer CLI and have a lot of company applications and their associated tasks to keep track of. The user interacts with it using a CLI, and it has a GUI created with JavaFX. It is written in Java, and has about 10 kLoC.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

### New Feature Developed:

Below is a summary of features developed:

#### Details field

An additional field for users to add optional details for the internship application.
Coded to use existing commands, reducing the application's complexity.
Respective UI element developed to display the new field.

#### Tag UI Component

Developed the Ui component to the various Tags, like Priority, application status and Regular tags, differentiating each 
tag type with a different color. The Ui component takes in the tagset stored in the application
and sets the tag color respectively based on the tag.
